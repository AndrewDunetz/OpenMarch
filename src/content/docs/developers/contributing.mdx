Get in here and contribute to OpenMarch! Learn our stack codebase here.

We'd reccommend to take a look at all of our [tasks](https://github.com/OpenMarch/OpenMarch/issues), and pick some you'd like to work on. The ones with `good first issue` and `help wanted` tags are good for getting started.

Feel free to ask questions in the Discord if you're having problems with anything.

##  Running the Dev Environment

1. Download & install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
2. Download the code via git from the main branch (if you're contributing, [make a fork](https://github.com/OpenMarch/OpenMarch/fork) and clone your own repo): `git clone https://github.com/OpenMarch/OpenMarch.git`
    - You might need to download git for this. You can also use other methods like the GitHub CLI
3. Install dependencies: `npm install` (may take a while)
    - You might get a bunch of scary npm errors after installing. If running the app doesn't work after, follow [these steps](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas?tab=readme-ov-file#compiling) to fix it.
4. Run the dev environment: `npm run dev`

## Codebase Structure

Our simplified directory structure:

- `/electron` - The "main" process, the backend of the app, with database and system functionality
    - /database
    - /main
    - /preload - Preload script for IPC
- `/src` - the "renderer" process, this is our react frontend.
    - `/components` - In here you find all the components of OpenMarch, the sidebars, titlebar, dialogs, UI component primitives. All of them are in their subfolder.
    - `/context` - React Context for the app of some sort of state/value
    - `/global` - Classes, objects and functions for various items in the app, such as Page, Marcher, MarcherShape, etc.
    - `/stores` - Global stores for certain items and actions, such as the list of Pages and Marchers
    - `App.tsx` - the main app file

Most of the directories like `stores`, `context`, `database` also have a `__test__` directory. These are [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) or [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) tests, which test the functionalites of certain things. Tests are important, please write them!
