##  Running the Dev Environment

1. Download & install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
2. Download the code via git from the main branch (if you're contributing, [make a fork](https://github.com/OpenMarch/OpenMarch/fork) and clone your own repo): `git clone https://github.com/OpenMarch/OpenMarch.git`
    - You might need to download git for this. You can also use other methods like the GitHub CLI
3. Install dependencies: `npm install` (may take a while)
    - You might get a bunch of scary npm errors after installing. If running the app doesn't work after, follow [these steps](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas?tab=readme-ov-file#compiling) to fix it.
4. Run the dev environment: `npm run dev`

Feel free to ask questions in the Discord if you're having problems.
