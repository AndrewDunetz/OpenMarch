## The open source drill writing software project

[OpenMarch](https://github.com/AlexDumo/OpenMarch) is a free open source drill writing software built on web app frameworks.
It will be released as cross platform desktop app.

**Check out the [July 2024 Update](/jekyll/update/2024/07/04/updates.html) for the most recent demo!**

Building a desktop app takes a village. To build a niche app is even harder. The UI needs to be organized, the UX needs
to make sense, the app can't crash, and the website can't look ugly. Currently, none of these things are true, and I
need all the help I can get!

OpenMarch is looking people with the following skills to help contribute -

- Web Development ([**React**](https://react.dev/))
- Desktop software integration ([**Electron**](https://www.electronjs.org/) and deployment)
- GitHub open source project management
- UI/UX design
- Web design (for this ugly website)
- Graphic design (logo and branding)

We also need better insight as to what OpenMarch should be!

- Drill writers to test and request features
- Visual educators to advise what makes good drill and how that can be baked into design

See the [About](about.markdown) page for onboarding.
