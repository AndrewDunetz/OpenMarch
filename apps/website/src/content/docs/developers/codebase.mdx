Learn about the codebase here.

We'd recommend looking at all of our [issues](https://github.com/OpenMarch/OpenMarch/issues) and picking some you'd like to work on. The ones with `good first issue` and `help wanted` tags are good for getting started.

Feel free to ask questions on the Discord if you have problems with anything.
