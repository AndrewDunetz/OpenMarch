Music in OpenMarch is separated into two parts:

<CardGrid>
  {/* cspell:disable-next-line */}
  <Card title="Audio" icon="seti:audio">
    The actual sound that you want to play. E.g. a `.mp3` or `.wav` file
  </Card>
  {/* cspell:disable-next-line */}
  <Card title="Tempo" icon="seti:happenings">
    The tempos, measures, and other timing information that you want to line the
    show up with the audio.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Importing Music

OpenMarch supports importing `.mp3`, `.wav`, or `.ogg` audio files.

To add an audio file to your show, follow these steps:

<Steps>

1. Open the `Music` tab
1. Click the empty dropdown
1. Select `Import Audio`
1. From the file popup, select the audio file you want to import
1. The page will automatically refresh and you should see the audio file in the `Music` tab and a waveform in the timeline!

</Steps>

## Setting the Tempo

<Aside type="caution" title="Tempo drift">

Quickly pausing and playing typically fixes this.
We are working to fix this

> If OpenMarch ever seems broken, refreshing the page `Ctrl + R` will often fix it.
