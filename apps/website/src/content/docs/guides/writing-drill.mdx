We have support for basic shapes, and alignment tools.

### Toolbar

In the toolbar you will see a `Coordinate Rounding` option. This will allow you to round coordinates, which means the marchers will snap to the grid. You can left/right click on the `X` and `Y` to rotate through the options, or open the menu to enter a custom value.

In the rest of the toolbar, you can lock X/Y movement, align vertical, and align horizontal. And you can place marchers to the same position as the previous or next pages.

### Manipulating marchers

Select multiple marchers by dragging, `Ctrl/Cmd+A`, or hold shift while dragging to use the lasso tool. Once you have multiple selected, you can click:

- `Create Line` in the marcher inspector on the right, prompting you to draw a line. Then you can either apply those coordinates, or group the marchers together to create a `Shape`.
- You can rotate the selected marchers by dragging the rotation box.
- You can also expand, contract, and rotate with the selection box on the field canvas.

### Shapes

After you've created a shape (see above), you can add multiple segments, such as straight lines and curves. You can also add `Move`, where you can move the segment to a new position. And you can add `Close`, which will close the shape pathway to the first segment.
