Welcome to OpenMarch! If you haven't already, [download](/download) and install the latest version. Let's get you set up to start writing drill.

## Creating Your First Project

<Steps>

1. **Create a new file** - Click "Create New" on the launch page and save your `.dots` file.

2. **Add your marchers** - Click the marchers icon in the sidebar, then "Add" to create sections. Fill in the quantity and section info, then hit create. Repeat for each section you need.

3. **Import your music** (optional) - If you have a MusicXML file and audio from your notation software:

   Click the music icon in the sidebar, then "Import MusicXML". Next, click the "Audio File" box to import your audio. You might need to refresh (`Ctrl/Cmd+R`) for the audio to show up.

   :::note
   MusicXML import can be buggy. If it doesn't work, try creating tempo groups manually instead. See our [music guide](/guides/music) for details.
