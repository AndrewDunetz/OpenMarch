> **Note:** When "Trackpad Mode" is enabled, scrolling with two fingers on a trackpad will pan the canvas.
> When it's disabled, scrolling will zoom the canvas, similar to using a mouse wheel.
> Pinch-to-zoom is available regardless of this setting.
>
> In either mode, you can also use the `Ctrl` key while scrolling to zoom in and out.
