OpenMarch's superpower is you.

We love hearing from designers. Whether something’s not quite working or you’ve got an idea for a new feature, we want to hear about it.
Your feedback helps make the app better for everyone in the community.

---

## 💬 Where Should I Post Feedback?

Honestly? **Wherever is most comfortable for you.** You can:

- Chat with us in the [OpenMarch Discord](https://discord.openmarch.com)
- Post in the [Facebook User Group](https://facebook-group.openmarch.com)
- Or, if you’re feeling a little technical — submit a GitHub issue (more on that below)

All three are welcome and valuable. No matter where you post, we’ll see it and do our best to respond.

---

## 🧠 What’s a GitHub issue?

Not sure how that works? No worries — we’ll help you out.

A **GitHub issue** is like an official suggestion box for OpenMarch. It’s where you can:

- Report bugs (something didn’t work right)
- Suggest new features (something you wish the app could do)
- Give feedback (something could be better)

Every issue goes into our to-do list so we can keep track of it, fix it, and keep discussions related to it in one place.
Think of it like a sticky note that won’t fall off the wall until we've addressed it.

> **What is GitHub?**
>
> GitHub is a platform that allows you to manage your code and collaborate with others.
> All our code, bug reports, and feature requests are open to the public and hosted on GitHub.

## 💬 Why not just post on Discord or Facebook?

We _do_ read the Discord and Facebook, but posts there can get buried quickly. Here’s why issues work better:

- ✅ We won’t lose track of your request
- ✅ We can ask follow-up questions in one place
- ✅ We can link issues directly to code updates
- ✅ Other users can upvote or add to your idea
- ✅ You’ll get notified when we fix or build it!

## 🛠️ How to Submit an Issue

To submit an issue, you need to have a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.
They're free to create and a standard part of the open source community.

### Select an issue template

- 💡 [Request a feature](https://github.com/OpenMarch/OpenMarch/issues/new?template=bug_report.md)
- 🐛 [Report a bug](https://github.com/OpenMarch/OpenMarch/issues/new?template=feature_request.md)
- ✨ [Create a blank issue](https://github.com/OpenMarch/OpenMarch/issues/new)

### Name the issue

Depending on the issue template you selected, the title will be pre-filled with either `[BUG]: ` or `[FEATURE]: `.
Add a title after the colon so we can easily identify the issue.

![Add a title after BUG or FEATURE](/docs/about/submitting-feedback/issue-title.gif)

### Fill out the form

GitHub issues are written in Markdown.
You don't need to be a technical wizard to understand how it works, all you need to do is fill in the blanks.

For example, if you're reporting a bug, this is what it might look like:

```markdown
**What happened?**
_Tell us what went wrong or what didn’t work the way you expected_

I was trying to create a circle and OpenMarch froze.

**How could we repeat this?**
_Walk us through what you were doing before the issue came up. If you’re not sure, just give us your best guess!_

1. I created 10 marchers
2. I created a line with those same 10 marchers
3. I then changed that line to a circle
4. OpenMarch froze

**Any screenshots or screen recordings?**
_If it helps show what went wrong, feel free to include a screenshot or recording (GIFs are great too!)_

**What kind of computer are you using?**

- _Operating system_: macOS 14.5
- _OpenMarch version_: 0.0.10

**If willing, upload your `.dots` file**
_Being able to debug with the file itself is very helpful_

[Uploaded dots file](uploaded-dots-file.dots.txt)
```

If at any point you want to see what your issue will look like, you can preview it by clicking the **Preview** button.

![Preview issue](/docs/about/submitting-feedback/preview-issue.gif)

### Submit the issue

Press the **Create** button to create the issue.

That’s it! 🎉
We’ll get a notification and take it from there.

Be sure to check back for updates on your issue, especially if we have follow-up questions.
GitHub will send you an email when we reply to your issue (assuming you've enabled email notifications).

## 🧡 We’re a Small Team — and Your Help Matters

OpenMarch is built by a small group of passionate volunteers and developers.
When you submit an issue, you’re helping us build a better tool for you _and_ for the entire marching arts community.

So thank you. Truly.
