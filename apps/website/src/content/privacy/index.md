**Data Storage:**

- Data is stored on **PostHogâ€™s servers**, which may be located in the United States or other jurisdictions depending on their hosting configuration.

> **Note:** Session recordings may capture user input behavior (e.g., text typed into form fields), but we do not intentionally record or store sensitive personal data like passwords or payment information.
