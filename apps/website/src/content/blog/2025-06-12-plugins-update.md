Happy June!
This development update brings a brand new plugin system for all of you aspiring developers who want to help make OpenMarch better.

## Plugin Panel

The is now a "Plugins" button in the OpenMarch toolbar that opens a new panel.
This panel lets you:

- See all plugins currently installed (and gives you the option to remove them)
- Use the Internetâ„¢ to get official and community OpenMarch plugins in a nice list right inside of OpenMarch
  - From this list, you can install plugins approved by us (that means no malware!) inside of OpenMarch without ever having to touch an `.om.js` file

### Making Your Own Plugin

From our new [Plugin Repository](https://github.com/OpenMarch/plugins), there are a few requirements when creating plugins:

1. Plugin file names must be unique. You cannot publish to the plugin repository under a name that has been taken.
2. The plugin's file extension must end in .om.js.
3. Metadata is required in the file in a specific format, shown in the example below.
4. The plugin's code may be contained within a single function named for the plugin to avoid conflicts with other plugins.

Plugins are loaded from the plugins directory within the OpenMarch app data folder (E.g. `%appdata%/OpenMarch/plugins` on Windows).

- Simply create a file that ends with the `.om.js` extension, and this script will be loaded in the main window on startup.
- The plugin's code will be run as if it were in a `&lt;script&gt;` tag within the main window (which is how plugins are loaded into OpenMarch).

### Submitting a Plugin

To submit a plugin to the repository, you will submit a pull request to the [OpenMarch/plugins](https://github.com/OpenMarch/plugins) repository.
This pull request should:

- Create a file under the `/community/` directory with the `.om.js` extension
  - This file should have a unique name
- Contain a name, version, author, and description of the plugin to be added

### Example plugin

Below is an example plugin for OpenMarch. You may use it as a template for your own plugins.

`rainbowBorders.om.js`

```js
// Name: RainbowBorders
// Description: Adds a rainbow border effect to Marchers that are currently moving.
// Version: 1.0.0
// Author: OpenMarch Developers

async function RainbowBorders() {
  let canvas = window.canvas;
  if (!canvas) {
    // Retry after 1 second if canvas is not found
    console.log("Canvas element not found, retrying in 1 second...");
    setTimeout(RainbowBorders, 1000);
    return;
  }
  console.log("RainbowBorders loaded successfully!");
  setInterval(() => {
    canvas._objects.forEach((element) => {
      if (element.classString === "Marcher" && element.isMoving) {
        const colors = [
          "#FF5733",
          "#33FF57",
          "#3357FF",
          "#F1C40F",
          "#8E44AD",
          "#E74C3C",
          "#2ECC71",
          "#3498DB",
        ];
        const randomColor = colors[Math.floor(Math.random() * colors.length)];

        element.set("borderColor", randomColor);
      }
    });
  }, 100);
}
RainbowBorders();
```
