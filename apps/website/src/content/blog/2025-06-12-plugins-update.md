- Welcome to this OpenMarch Development Update! This edition brings a brand new
  plugin system for all of you aspiring developers who want to help make OpenMarch better.

## New Features

### Plugin Panel

- A "Plugins" button in the OpenMarch toolbar that opens a new panel
- A new Plugins panel with many features
  - See all plugins currently installed
    - This also gives you the option to remove them
  - Use the Internetâ„¢ to get official and community OpenMarch plugins in a nice list right inside of OpenMarch
    - From this list, you can install plugins approved by us (that means no malware!) inside of OpenMarch without ever having to touch an `.om.js` file

#### The panel in action:

### Making Your Own Plugin

- This is the technical side of things, and is almost copied verbatim from our new [Plugin Repository](https://github.com/OpenMarch/plugins)
- There are a few requirements when creating plugins:

  1. Plugin file names must be unique. You cannot publish to the plugin repository under a name that has been taken.
  2. The plugin's file extension must end in .om.js.
  3. Metadata is required in the file in a specific format, shown in the example below.
  4. The plugin's code may be contained within a single function named for the plugin to avoid conflicts with other plugins.

- Plugins are loaded from the plugins directory within the OpenMarch app data folder (e.g., %appdata%/OpenMarch/plugins on Windows operating systems).
- Simply create a file that ends with the .om.js extension, and this script will be loaded in the main window on startup.
- The plugin's code will be run as if it were in a &lt;script&gt; tag within the main window (this is literally how plugins are loaded into OpenMarch).

#### Submitting a Plugin

- To submit a plugin to the repository, create a pull request to add a file under the /community/ directory in the repository ([OpenMarch/plugins](https://github.com/OpenMarch/plugins)). The pull request must contain a name, version, author, and description of the plugin to be added. The only change the pull request should make is to add the file appropriately and uniquely named with a .om.js file extension.

#### Example plugin

- Below is an example plugin for OpenMarch. You may use it as a template for your own plugins.

`rainbowBorders.om.js`

```js
// Name: RainbowBorders
// Description: Adds a rainbow border effect to Marchers that are currently moving.
// Version: 1.0.0
// Author: OpenMarch Developers

async function RainbowBorders() {
  let canvas = window.canvas;
  if (!canvas) {
    // Retry after 1 second if canvas is not found
    console.log("Canvas element not found, retrying in 1 second...");
    setTimeout(RainbowBorders, 1000);
    return;
  }
  console.log("RainbowBorders loaded successfully!");
  setInterval(() => {
    canvas._objects.forEach((element) => {
      if (element.classString === "Marcher" && element.isMoving) {
        const colors = [
          "#FF5733",
          "#33FF57",
          "#3357FF",
          "#F1C40F",
          "#8E44AD",
          "#E74C3C",
          "#2ECC71",
          "#3498DB",
        ];
        const randomColor = colors[Math.floor(Math.random() * colors.length)];

        element.set("borderColor", randomColor);
      }
    });
  }, 100);
}
RainbowBorders();
```
