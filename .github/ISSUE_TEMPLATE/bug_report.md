**What happened?**
_Tell us what went wrong or what didn’t work the way you expected_

YOUR RESPONSE

**How could we repeat this?**
_Walk us through what you were doing before the issue came up. If you’re not sure, just give us your best guess!_

YOUR RESPONSE

**Any screenshots or screen recordings?**
_If it helps show what went wrong, feel free to include a screenshot or recording (GIFs are great too!)_

YOUR RESPONSE

**What kind of computer are you using?**

- _Operating system_: (e.g. Windows 11, macOS 14)
- _OpenMarch version_: (you can find this in the app settings or title bar)

**If willing, upload your `.dots` file**
_Being able to debug with the file itself is very helpful_

Before uploading your `.dots` file here, change the extension to `.txt` so GitHub allows uploading.
